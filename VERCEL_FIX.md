# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue

The project was failing to build on Vercel due to a dependency conflict between React 19 and @react-jvectormap/core, which only supports React up to version 18.

Error message:
```
npm error While resolving: @react-jvectormap/core@1.0.4
npm error Found: react@19.1.0
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer react@"^16.8 || ^17 || ^18" from @react-jvectormap/core@1.0.4
```

## Solution

Downgraded React from version 19 to version 18.2.0, which is compatible with all dependencies:

1. Updated `react` and `react-dom` to version `^18.2.0`
2. Updated type definitions `@types/react` to `^18.2.65` 
3. Updated type definitions `@types/react-dom` to `^18.2.22`

This ensures compatibility with @react-jvectormap/core, which is used for the map visualization components.

## Alternatives Considered

Other potential solutions would include:
1. Using a different map library that supports React 19
2. Using `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps` flags, but this could lead to runtime issues
3. Creating a custom implementation without @react-jvectormap/core

Downgrading React was chosen as the simplest and most reliable solution for this application.
